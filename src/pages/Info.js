        <Paragraph>
          The Access Insights Platform (AIP) is an interactive, open-source data aggregation and
          visualization platform that provides key insights on factors related
          to household and community level supply and demand of electricity,
          demographics, socio-economics trends, and other factors relevant to last-mile distrubiton eneterprises. The AIP utilizes predictive
          algorithms to visually depict population density and key infrastructure
          (e.g., electricity grids) and allows users to visualize mobile network coverage and the locations of health facilities, financial
          institutions (banks, MFIs, SACCOs), and other key infrastructure.

          geographically defined areas.
