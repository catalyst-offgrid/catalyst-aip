        <Paragraph>
          The Access Insights Platform (AIP) is an interactive, open-source data
          aggregation and visualization platform that provides key insights on
          factors related to household and community level supply and demand of
          electricity, demographics, socio-economics trends, and other factors
          relevant to last-mile distrubiton enterprises. The geospatial module
          utilizes predictive algorithms to visually depict population density
          and key infrastructure (e.g., electricity grids) and allows users to
          visualize mobile network coverage and the locations of health
          facilities, financial institutions (banks, MFIs, SACCOs), and other
          key infrastructure. Separately, AIP's MTF module offers users the
          opportunity to interact with the powerful Multi-Tier framework survey
          datasets which cover household access to electricity and clean cooking
          and go beyond the binary approach to look at access as a spectrum of
          service levels experienced by households.

          AIPâ€™s objective is to help organizations make well-informed strategic
          decisions in the markets in which they operate or intend to operate in
          the future, helping them understand opportunities and risks in
          geographically defined areas.
